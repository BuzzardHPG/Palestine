 <h1>Welcome to<span style="color:orange;"> Palestine</span>
 <h1>In the war of 2023.</h1>
 <h3>
 <p>Palestine is an ancient Arab Islamic country located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, where it was occupied by the Jews, which deprived it of large parts of its lands and Hamas attack At 6:30 a.m. on October 7, 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,” and announced that it had fired more than 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within 20 minutes From October 8 until now, Israel has been killing and exterminating the people of Gaza.The road to Palestine is approaching and it will be free and in our hands. Palestine remains from its sea to its river. We carried the olive branch, not to drop the gun. We carried the olive branch to restore identity to the land of Olive. Let all the lost people know that the revolution will remain a beacon for the cause. We will live as flying hawks, and we will die as proud lions, and we are all for the homeland, and we are all for Palestine.

 <h3>
 <p>Why is Palestine important to Muslims?

Jerusalem became a city of religious importance to Muslims after the angel Gabriel took the Prophet Muhammad captive there, according to Islamic belief, around the year 620, where he ascended from the holy rock to the highest heavens, where he met all the prophets and messengers who preceded him and received from God the teachings of prayer and how to perform it.
Since when has Gaza's pride, with its strength and stability, been a living and true source of inspiration for our free poets, and an Arab heart beating with truth, struggle and resistance? Since when has proud Gaza, with all the killing, terror and displacement surrounding it, been our bloody wound, our heart full of faith in the cause, and our radiant, yearning spirit aspiring to the unity, pride and peace of the Islamic natio
Oh God, be a helper and a helper for the people of Gaza, O Lord of the Worlds. Oh God, we entrust the people of Gaza and Palestine to you, so support them and protect them with your eyes that never sleep, and strengthen their hearts and provide them with your soldiers and send down your peace upon them and subject the earth and those on it to them.

  <h3>
  <pr>Description of Al-Aqsa Mosque?
<p>
Al-Aqsa Mosque is a beacon of hearts and a magician of minds. It penetrates the depths of the conscience of every Arab and Muslim. Because it is the symbol of Muslims in Palestine, which is the cradle of the heavenly religions, they sacrifice their blood and souls for it, and defend it with all their strength, determination, and persistence.<p>Al-Aqsa Mosque consists of several buildings, and contains several landmarks, numbering up to 200, including mosques, Domes, corridors, pulpits, minarets, wells, and other landmarks. Al-Aqsa Mosque includes both the Dome of the Rock (the golden dome) located in its heart, and the Al-Qibli Mosque (with the lead dome) located at its southernmost point, facing the Qiblah.

<h3>
<p>The most beautiful thing said in Al-Aqsa Mosque?

Jerusalem has homes and spaciousness in our hearts, and Al-Aqsa has its place of prayer one day.
Sorry, Quds, letters will be of no use one day, and for your sake, we will build a road to reach you.
O city of virginity and the shade through which the Messenger passed, we will pass through your streets one day and they will be safe.Al-Aqsa Mosque remained as it is now, even after the establishment of Israel, which seeks to build the Temple of Solomon or the Third Temple on the Temple Mount or the Holy Mosque. It made several attempts aimed at regaining the Temple by demolishing Al-Aqsa Mosque and erecting the Third Temple in its place, and the dispute still exists over it. Between Muslims and Jew </p>

   <h3>
   <p>On October 7, 2023, fighters from the Palestinian resistance factions were able to cross the Israel-Gaza barrier into the Gaza envelope area, in addition to firing rockets at Israel. Israel then declared war on Hamas, and summoned 300,000 reserve soldiers to carry out the Israeli military operationThe number of Palestinian casualties reached 3,785 martyrs and 12,500 others were injured as a result of Israeli air strikes, including 1,524 children, 1,000 women, and 120 elderly people, in addition to 12,493 others being injured with various injuries, including 3,983 children and 3,300 women.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health recorded the death of 44 medical personnel and the injury of 70 others, explaining that the Israeli occupation deliberately targeted 23 ambulances and put them out of service after they were completely destroyed.

    <h3>
    <p>
    The Israeli occupation army committed 484 massacres against Palestinian families since the start of its aggression against the Gaza Strip on October 7, claiming the lives of 2,776 martyrs. Hundreds are still under the rubble, more than 65% of whom are women and children.

Israel announced that 1,500 Israelis were killed, 4,000 others were wounded, and more than 200 Israeli soldiers were captured.

This toll remains an expression of the size of the human losses incurred by Palestinian citizens in the Gaza Strip as a result of the ongoing Israeli wars, noting that the death toll in Gaza from 2008 until May 2023 recorded the fall of 4,211 Palestinian martyrs, compared to the killing of only 118 Israelis.

  <h3>
  <p>
  For 100 days, Israel is considering a response to the October 7 attack and is seeking to achieve its goals of eliminating Hamas, securing its surroundings, and restoring detainees in the Gaza Strip, but none of these goals have been achieved yet.

The longest and bloodiest war between Israel and the Palestinians since 1948, it caused unprecedented devastation and a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza, left about 24 thousand dead, one million and 900 thousand displaced, and ignited the fire of escalation in the Middle East.
The writer of the most complex Hollywood movie scenarios could not have expected or imagined the scenario that the world woke up to on the morning of Saturday, October 7, 2023. At 6:25 a.m., thousands of rockets were launched from the Gaza Strip towards Israeli sites and towns inside the Green Line all at once and without... Introductions, and it became clear less than half an hour after the start of the operation that the launching of this amount of rockets and missiles was nothing more than a cover for a massive invasion operation by Palestinian resistance fighters inside the Green Line, causing many Israeli sites and settlements to fall into the hands of the fighters in an unprecedented, dramatic manner in an operation called (Al-Aqsa Flood), and on the other hand, Israel declares a state of war for the first time since declaring a state of war on the morning of Saturday, October 6, 1973, that is, exactly half a century ago.

     <p>
     The scenes that spread on the media and social media were shocking and surprising on all levels. What happened was not an infiltration because it did not happen secretly, but rather it was a real invasion at four hours in the day. To see Palestinian militants roaming the streets of the settlements that were established 75 years ago, and which until Friday were considered sites heavily fortified with the Iron Dome that protected them from the air, was not a common sight, because the danger surprised these settlements from the land, not the air this time. The naval attack, the features of which were not clear at the time of writing this article.

       The most beautiful thing said about the Palestinian child?
“Our hearts ache for the innocent children of Palestine. We stand by them with deep solidarity and unwavering support.”
“The children of Palestine tell stories of courage and resilience, and our solidarity is with them every step of their way.”
“In the eyes of the children of Palestine, we see the innocence of childhood that defies difficulties 
   <pr>How long this war will continue. No one knows how long this genocide will continue. How long the people of Gaza will remain displaced in schools and hospitals.
We hope that this war will end peacefully for the people of Gaza and that the rest of its people will be protected and protected from the enemie</p>

      <p>This is not humanity. They brutally kill children and women Do you know why they target women and children? because when the children grow up, they will take away the rights of their country and kill women because women are the ones who raise the children They killed the families of journalists in Gaza, and these days they are targeting the family of Wael Al-Dahdouh

        <p>These days, the Arabs are sending aid to Gaza and after the aid enters Gaza and then a massacre occurs "it's as if the world is addressing the people of Gaza enjoy a little water and food and then die But this is not a solution.
        What now to stop them and stop this genocide and these massacre ?
These sociopaths have to be stopped and most effective way is for"Americans"to pressure their government to stop this genocide 
- this is one of the solutions to stop them.

  <h3>
      <p> The conclusion we reach in the midst of these circumstances is that the entire Israeli project is today at stake, and I do not think that Israel can find a way out easily, and regardless of the final outcome of this process, its first victims will undoubtedly be three names: Netanyahu, Ben Gvir. And Smotrich.
